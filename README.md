# Hedera POAP
Hedera POAP is a project to implement POAP NFTs on the Hedera Network.

## What is a POAP?
According to the [orignal POAP site](https://poap.xyz/): 

> POAPs are digital mementos, minted in celebration of life's remarkable moments.
> Each POAP is a gift from an issuer to collectors, in celebration of a special shared memory.
> By minting these memories to the blockchain, collectors build a rich tapestry of tokenized experiences which unlock a world of possibilities.

Under the hood, POAPs are NFTs that are easily minted through a web3app. POAPs differ from "classic" NFTs in that each
instance or "drop" has multiple copies of it minted. Each copy is identical to each other copy with the exception of a
serial number.

## POAP Parameters
All POAPs are usually minted from the same contract and are distributed in "drops". To set up a drop, an event planner
provides the following information through a DAPP:

- name of the drop
- a description of the drop
- location of the event; city and country if it is a IRL event, or a URL for virtual events
- The dates that a POAP can be claimed (until minting is closed manually if not specified)
- date of the event
- an small image
- maximum quantity of POAPs in the drop (unlimited if not specified)
- a claim code that must be used to claim a POAP from a drop (optional)
- A list of addresses that can claim a POAP (optional)
- whether a POAP is transferable
- required assets (optional)
- required payment (free if not specified)

## Existing POAP Platforms
- [POAP](https://poap.xyz/) - The original POAP project (Gnosis/Ethereum)
- [FLOATS](https://floats.city/) - Flow Blockchain
